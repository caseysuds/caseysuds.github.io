    <body> I was born in Hampden Maine and I have lived here my whole life. I graduated from Hampden Academy, and during high school I played baseball and football and those were my two biggest hobbies. I decided to attend the University of Maine mainly due to how close it was to home. Another reason was because I have an older brother who goes to school here as well. I chose finance as my major mostly because I felt as though it's best suited for me and I want to be a part of a business during my job career.
